  <h1>History</h1>
<p>
In 2014, the company ran the largest crowdfunding initiative in Russia to date, raising over $2 million
 from 180 private investors. Dodo also made headlines from Washington to Tokyo with what it billed as 
 the world's first commercial delivery of pizzas by drone, to customers in the central square in
  Syktyvkar.
In September 2018, Fyodor Ovchinnikov announced that the chain would grow its IT team from 60 to 250 
developers in two years,and by October 2019, Dodo Pizza has doubled it.
According to the chain's public Top Pizza Shop Sales Ranking, the best-performing Dodo Pizza store 
in Novy Urengoy, Russia netted $166,086 in sales in March 2019.
In 2018, Dodo Pizza sold the franchise rights for Nigeria to Quality Foods Africa, the same group 
of British investors that brought Krispy Kreme to that continent's most populous country. The first
 of a planned 20 Dodos will open in October 2019 in Lagos.
In 2019, Dodo Pizza opened a cashless pizza store in China, its “primary market of the future”
 along with Britain. In November 2019, the company received GRLC Distinction Award for Innovation 
 at Global Restaurant Leadership Conference in Singapore.
In 2019, the company planned to add 1,000 pizza shops in Europe, Asia and Africa over the next 
five years and to hit $500 million in network revenue by 2021 and $1 billion by 2024.
In 2022, the founder of the network announced that the network would leave Great Britain, 
which included 5 Dodo Pizza outlets. One of the reasons for the network's problems was the 
economic sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, but British branches had
 already experienced declines in turnover.3
